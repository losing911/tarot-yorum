# Quickstart Guide for Modern Visual Design and Admin Panel Functions

This feature primarily focuses on frontend visual design and admin panel functionalities, which build upon the existing project setup. Therefore, the quickstart process remains largely the same as defined in the main project's quickstart guide.

Please refer to the main `quickstart.md` in the project root for detailed instructions on setting up the development environment, running the application, and executing tests.

This feature will involve working primarily within the `frontend/` directory for visual design and admin panel UI, and potentially extending existing backend APIs or creating new ones for admin-specific data interactions.
