# Data Model for Modern Visual Design and Admin Panel Functions

This feature primarily focuses on enhancing the user interface and experience, particularly for the admin panel. It does not introduce new core data entities. Instead, it interacts with and presents data from existing entities such as `User`, `SubscriptionPlan`, `Payment`, and `AICallLog` (as defined in the main feature's `data-model.md`).

Any new data requirements will be related to UI state, user preferences for the admin panel, or presentation logic, rather than fundamental business entities.
